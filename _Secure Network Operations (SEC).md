## 🧱 Hierarchical Network Design
*What is the most important part of a network? __The Core__*

<br>

Most common kinds of network architectures.
 - 2-tier                 __Cisco Collapsed Campus Core__
 - 3-tier                 __Enterprise Network Design__
 - Spine-leaf             __Data Center Fabric__

<br>

CORE Layer (__CoreTAAS__ & __CoreBABA__) - High Speed and Availability
  > [!NOTE]
  >*"A Network Engineer MUST avoid a single point of failure.
   __Always have a backup.__"*

<br>

Examples:
  | __Protocol__                 | __Supported Devices__    |
  | ---                          | ---                      |
  | Etherchannel                 | Cisco Catalyst..and more |
  | FlexStack (Master Switch)    | Cisco 2960 & 6500 Series |

### Lab Setup
__1. Run the *SOC-IR* virtual machine.__  

<br>

__2. VM Login information:__
> Username: root  
> Password: C1sc0123

<br>

__3. Get the IP address of the VM.__  
Enter the command inside the VM
~~~bash
@SOC-IR
ip addr
~~~

<br>

__4. Add a hostname mapping.__  
Access the __hosts__ file located on `c:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc`  
Then, enter add the following mapping to the hosts file:
~~~
rivan.cloudsoc.com  208.8.8.144
~~~

> [!Note]
> __208.8.8.144__ must be your virtual machine IP address.

## Know the jobs of a Switch
### ⚙️ 1. __POE__
*Are there switches that don't support POE? __Yes__.*
> [!NOTE]
> If you need PoE functionality on a non-PoE switch, use a PoE injector.

<br>

| IEEE Standards  | Power Output |
| ---             |     ---      |
| 802.3af (PoE)   |     15.4W    |
| 802.3at (PoE+)  |     25.5W    |
| 802.3bt (PoE++) |     71.3W    |

<br>

Which device consumes the most power? __SPI - `show power inline`__
~~~
!@CoreBABA
show power inline
~~~

<br>

> __ITSM__  
> Title: 1st Job of a Switch - PoE  
> Description: Purchase switches with PoE - 802.3af,at,bt  
> Justification: Switches need to supply the right amount of power depending on the needs of end devices.  

<br>
<br>

---
&nbsp;

### ⚙️ 2. SVI (Switch Virtual Interface)
*Why segment network traffic? __WireShark__*

<br>

> __ITSM__  
> Title: 2nd Job of a Switch - SVI  
> Description: Configure IP addresses on switches  
> Justification: Segment network traffic to reduce security risks and network traffic congestion.

Verify Connectivity:

!@cmd
ping 10.31.1.4

<br>

Although unsecure, why do some companies still utilize a Flat Network? *Simple and low cost*  
__BUT__  
*You get what you pay for*
- __Slow network traffic__ | Performance Bottlenecks
- __Security Risks__ | Succeptible to attacks 
- __Single point of failure__

<br>

~~~
!@cmd
nmap -sP 10.28.0.0/24
nmap -O 10.28.0.0/24
~~~

<br>

__2. Scanning - find open ports, active devices, and services. Find Vulnerabilities__
~~~
!@cmd
nmap -v 10.31.1.2
~~~

<br>

Is port __23/Telnet__ open?  
Is port __445/Microsoft-DS & 139/ServerMessageBlock__ open?  

<br>

__3. Gaining Access - Utilize weaknesses and establish connectivity__
*How to access port 445 because you don't have a Firewall!*
~~~
!@cmd
net use \\10.28.0.x\ipc$
net use x: /delete
net use x: \\10.28.0.x\c$
~~~

<br>

__4. Maintain Access - Install backdoors, rootkits, or Trojan for continued access.__
ex. Keylogger

<br>

__5. Clear Tracks - remain under the radar. Wipe logs, conceal files, manipulate timestamps.__
Detect who is connected to you
~~~
!@cmd
netstat -s -p tcp

### ⚙️ 2. OSPF ROUTING
*At what capacity do you want your devices to run?*

~~~
!@edge
conf t
router ospf 1
router-id 31.0.0.1
network 200.0.0.0 0.0.0.255 area 0
network 10.31.31.0 0.0.0.255 area 0
network 31.0.0.1 0.0.0.0 area 0
int gi 0/0/0
ip ospf network point-to-point
end
~~~

<br>

~~~
@coreBaba
conf t
router ospf 1
router-id 10.31.31.4
network 10.31.0.0 0.0.255.255 area 0
int gi0/1
ip ospf network point-to-point
~~~

<br>

~~~
@cucm
conf t
router ospf 1
router-id 10.31.100.8
network 10.31.100.0 0.0.0.255 area 0
end

*Verify: How to check if OSPF is working? <br>
  __SIP - `show ip protocols`__ <br>
  __SION - `show ip ospf neighbor`__ <br>
  __SIRO - `show ip route ospf`__* <br>

### Now that routing is in place, there's no need to jump to access CUCM.
Ping

~~~
!@cmd
ping 10.31.1.2                 CoreTAAS
ping 10.31.1.4                 CoreBABA
ping 10.31.100.8               CUCM
ping 10.31.31.1            EDGE
